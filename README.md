# CPP_00

Welcome to the CPP_00 project repository! This project is part of the curriculum at 42 School and serves as an introduction to C++ programming. The aim of this module is to familiarize students with the basics of C++, including syntax, data types, and fundamental concepts.

## Introduction

CPP_00 is designed to teach the basics of C++ programming. Students will learn about:
- C++ syntax and basic constructs
- Data types, variables, and constants
- Input and output operations
- Functions and control structures
- Basic object-oriented programming concepts

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
```
CPP_00/
├── ex00/
│ ├── main.cpp
│ ├── Makefile
│ └── ...
├── ex01/
│ ├── main.cpp
│ ├── Makefile
│ └── ...
├── ex02/
│ ├── main.cpp
│ ├── Makefile
│ └── ...
└── README.md
```


Each directory `ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`, etc., contains exercises with their respective `main.cpp` files and `Makefile`s.

## Installation

To get started with the project, you need to clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CPP_00.git
cd CPP_00
```
## Usage

Navigate to the directory of the exercise you want to compile and run. For example, to compile and run ex00:
```
cd ex00
make
./megaphone
```
Each exercise comes with its own Makefile to simplify the compilation process.

## Objectives

The main objectives of CPP_00 are to:

- Understand and apply basic C++ syntax
- Perform input and output operations
- Implement basic control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Define and use functions
- Get an introduction to object-oriented programming in C++
